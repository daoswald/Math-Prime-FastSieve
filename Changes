Revision history for Perl extension Math::Prime::FastSieve.

0.11  Sat May 26 00:36:00 PDT 2012
    - Memory and speed performance improvements contributed by Dana Jacobsen:
      Represent only odds in the bit sieve (halving the size).
    - Improved type safety (explicitly specify UL and static casting of
      size_type to UL where it makes sense to do so).
    - Added proper (modern) C++ class member data initializers.
    - FastSieve.pm now perlcritic friendly at all severity levels.
    - Worked through a bunch of Perl::Critic issues in the test suite.

0.10  Thu May 24 23:48:00 PDT 2012
    - Added an END{} block with code that will satisfy Inline so that no
      warnings are generated if M::P::FS is "require"d instead of "use"d.
      (Issue raised by Dana Jacobsen, patch by Sisyphus -- Thanks all!)
    - Patched both implementations of the Primes Sieve of Eratosthenes to
      increment inner loop j+=2 instead of ++j.  This optimization yields a
      substantial performance increase (in the area of 20-30%) for the
      exported 'primes()' function, for example. ( Suggestion from
      Dana Jacobsen ).
    - Converted all subs to accept longs instead of ints as parameters, as
      well as to return longs.  That means for Perls compiled with long
      support, the prime sieve can go past 2.7 billion. ( Again, thanks to
      Dana Jacobsen for the suggestion.
    - NOTE: If smoke testing determines that the 'long' support breaks
      compatibility with 32 bit Perls this particular patch may be rolled
      back, or may be implemented as a separate function that only compiles
      into 64 bit Perls.  In this release, 'long' support is experimental.

    - Fixed email address in Makefile.PL.  How did I miss that for so long?
    - Added 'META_MERGE => provides' field to Makefile.PL

0.08  Tue May 08 00:38:00 PDT 2012
    - Inline::CPP version requirement is now 0.39.
    - Inline and Inline::C requirement is now v0.50.
    - Explicit version number requirements for ExtUtils::MakeMaker and
      Test::More.
    - MIN_PERL_VERSION meta tag now used instead of 'use 5.006000;' at the top
      of Makefile.PL.  This is cleaner and nicer.
    - Added optional RELEASE_TESTING tests for Perl::Critic, Test::Pod,
      and Test::Pod::Coverage.

    - Bump Inline::CPP version requirement to 0.34 to gain broader
      install success.  Inline::CPP v0.33 was failing for a lot of smokers.
      V0.34 seems to be much better in that regard, so by requiring that
      version more smokers will be able to set up M::P::FS.

0.06  Sat Jan 20 09:23:00 PST 2012
    - Fixed "world writable" directories (that's what I get for preparing
      a distro via Windows.

0.05  Sat Jan 20 01:37:00 PST 2012
    - Repaired test suite (mistakenly omitted from previous distribution).
    - Converted all C++ subs to type-safe unsigned ints and
      std::vector<bool>::size_type to eliminate potential for signed
      roll-over errors.  Note: input params are still signed ints because
      pure-Perl offers no means of creating an SV containing a UV.

    - Listed Inline::MakeMaker as both a BUILD_REQUIRES and a
      CONFIG_REQUIRES so that the various installation tools (cpan, cpanm,
      cpanplus) pull in the module prior to running Makefile.PL.
    - Documentation improvements.
    - Added a few more tests.
    - Set minimum Perl version to 5.6.0.  If this causes smoke test failures
      I will revert to 5.8.0 again.

0.03  Tue Dec 13 15:17:00 2011
    - Revisions to the documentation.
    - Listed Inline as a build dependency in an effort to get better
      successful install rate, particularly among people who haven't
      already installed Inline.  This should deal with the issue that
      Inline::MakeMaker isn't found, causing Makefile.PL to abort.
    - Added ranged_primes() method.
    - Added tests for ranged_primes method.

0.02  Sun Dec 11 23:46:00 2011
    - Fixed minimum Perl version: was 5.14.2.  Now 5.8.0.

0.01  Sat Dec 10 00:10:33 2011
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
