Revision history for Perl extension Math::Prime::FastSieve.
0.05  Sat Jan 20 01:37:00 PST 2011
    - Repaired test suite (mistakenly omitted from previous distribution).
    - Converted all C++ subs to type-safe unsigned ints and
      std::vector<bool>::size_type to eliminate potential for signed
      roll-over errors.  Note: input params are still signed ints because
      pure-Perl offers no means of creating an SV containing a UV.

    - Listed Inline::MakeMaker as both a BUILD_REQUIRES and a
      CONFIG_REQUIRES so that the various installation tools (cpan, cpanm,
      cpanplus) pull in the module prior to running Makefile.PL.
    - Documentation improvements.
    - Added a few more tests.
    - Set minimum Perl version to 5.6.0.  If this causes smoke test failures
      I will revert to 5.8.0 again.
0.03  Tue Dec 13 15:17:00 2011
    - Revisions to the documentation.
    - Listed Inline as a build dependency in an effort to get better
      successful install rate, particularly among people who haven't
      already installed Inline.  This should deal with the issue that
      Inline::MakeMaker isn't found, causing Makefile.PL to abort.
    - Added ranged_primes() method.
    - Added tests for ranged_primes method.
