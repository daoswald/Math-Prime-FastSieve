Revision history for Perl extension Math::Prime::FastSieve.

0.09  ????????????????????????????
    - Fixed email address in Makefile.PL.  How did I miss that for so long?

0.08  Tue May 08 00:38:00 PST 2012
    - Inline::CPP version requirement is now 0.39.
    - Inline and Inline::C requirement is now v0.50.
    - Explicit version number requirements for ExtUtils::MakeMaker and
      Test::More.
    - MIN_PERL_VERSION meta tag now used instead of 'use 5.006000;' at the top
      of Makefile.PL.  This is cleaner and nicer.
    - Added optional RELEASE_TESTING tests for Perl::Critic, Test::Pod,
      and Test::Pod::Coverage.
0.07  Tue Feb 07 09:39:00 PST 2012
    - Bump Inline::CPP version requirement to 0.34 to gain broader
      install success.  Inline::CPP v0.33 was failing for a lot of smokers.
      V0.34 seems to be much better in that regard, so by requiring that
      version more smokers will be able to set up M::P::FS.
0.06  Sat Jan 20 09:23:00 PST 2012
    - Fixed "world writable" directories (that's what I get for preparing
      a distro via Windows.
0.05  Sat Jan 20 01:37:00 PST 2012
    - Repaired test suite (mistakenly omitted from previous distribution).
    - Converted all C++ subs to type-safe unsigned ints and
      std::vector<bool>::size_type to eliminate potential for signed
      roll-over errors.  Note: input params are still signed ints because
      pure-Perl offers no means of creating an SV containing a UV.
0.04  Wed Dec 14 21:33:00 2011
    - Listed Inline::MakeMaker as both a BUILD_REQUIRES and a
      CONFIG_REQUIRES so that the various installation tools (cpan, cpanm,
      cpanplus) pull in the module prior to running Makefile.PL.
    - Documentation improvements.
    - Added a few more tests.
    - Set minimum Perl version to 5.6.0.  If this causes smoke test failures
      I will revert to 5.8.0 again.
0.03  Tue Dec 13 15:17:00 2011
    - Revisions to the documentation.
    - Listed Inline as a build dependency in an effort to get better
      successful install rate, particularly among people who haven't
      already installed Inline.  This should deal with the issue that
      Inline::MakeMaker isn't found, causing Makefile.PL to abort.
    - Added ranged_primes() method.
    - Added tests for ranged_primes method.
0.02  Sun Dec 11 23:46:00 2011
    - Fixed minimum Perl version: was 5.14.2.  Now 5.8.0.
0.01  Sat Dec 10 00:10:33 2011
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
